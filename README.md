# 🛒 Discount Calculator

Welcome to the **Discount Calculator** — your handy tool for figuring out if that *"SALE 20% OFF!!!"* sign is really worth it.  

---

## ✨ What It Does
- Takes the **original price** of an item 💰  
- Takes the **discount percentage** 🎯  
- If the discount is **20% or higher** → applies the discount  
- Otherwise → keeps the original price (sorry, 10% off won’t cut it 😅)  

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. Run the script
2. Enter the original price  
3. Enter the discount percentage  
4. Boom! 🎉 You get the final price

---

## ▶️ Example Runs

```text
Enter the original price: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final Price: 750.00

⚡ Extra Notes

If you type something that’s not a number… the program will scold you politely 🙃

You can change the threshold (currently 20%) if you feel generous 🤑

🎉 Have Fun Shopping!

Remember: sometimes the best discount is not buying it at all.
